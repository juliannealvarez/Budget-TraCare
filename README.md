## Budget-Tracare

Money has become a very crucial aspect of living as it allows us to buy the necessities of life such as food, clothing, and shelter. It is considered to be significant as, without money, we would not be able to pursue our education, pay for medications, and avail of important services in the market. Generally, money revolves around everything that we do and acquire. 

According to the Cambridge Dictionary, budgeting is the process of calculating how much money you must earn or save during a particular time, and of planning how you will spend it [1]. Students need to learn the basics of budgeting so that they will have sufficient money to buy the things they need in the future. Knowing how to prioritize their needs will also prevent them from buying unnecessary things and therefore lead to saving money. 

With the Budget TraCare program, students will be able to manage their finances properly. It will allow them to input their expenses as well as check if they have exceeded their budget. This program will serve as their stepping stone in organizing and planning their finances. This will also teach them the importance of proper money handling and be able to save money in the future. Furthermore, this program can only be accessed by a specific user as it contains a log-in feature making use of a username and password.
